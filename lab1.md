Reading assignments
	
	1. NA

	2. Be as clear as possible on how the answer is applicable and how it works. Dont stray from the topic and confuse the person.

	3. Chapter three of free culture is very intriguing. It began peaceful and inspiring then turned bad very quickly. In
	the end I feel angered by the entire situation. It was amazing that Jesse was able to do all that he did as a college 
	student and horrible that what he created was taken advantage of. It outrages me that someone creating something a 
	powerful framework was punished because people used it for bad purposes. It is hard for me to understand how or why 
	the RIAA would do that to Jesse. If he was not profiting from any of this at all it makes no sense that they can say 
	he owes money. I also feel for him because I know someone who had a similar situation happen where there were innocent 
	but it is easier to settle than fight a lawsuit.

Reflection

	I am thinking about projects that are valuable to me by looking at what is important in my life and thinking about 
	ways I can improve what goes on with them. Additionally I am thinking of past projects I completed and how I can do 
	something similar in a different capacity. In the past I created an attendance server for my fraternity and it has 
	come in handy quite often.
