## Why is it important to choose a license?:
It is important to choose a license because it sets terms for which the software may be used, modified or distributed. It allows the copyright holder to create the formal permissions for the softwares use. If you do not use a license agreement software can be in a state of legal uncertainty where users do not know the limitations you want to enforce. This leaves the you vulnerable to legal claims and you can have difficulty controlling how the work is used. 

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If their is no license agreement, software can be in a state of legal uncertainty where users do not know the limitations the owners want to enforce. This leaves the everyone vulnerable to legal claims. This uncertainty leads to discouraging potential users who want to use the code.

## Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
### Do you agree with this claim? Write two to five sentences.
I agree with the authors claim. He shows clearly how they feel into a forking situation too early. The examples he provides show a strong argument that gopher failed.

## Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
Android uses the apache license 2.0 because they do not want to publish the source code of android aside from linux. They would like to use android as non-free software for the purposes of making money. While they use linux as the kernel only which is open source and free.
